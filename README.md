# Gravity Simulation
A real-time 2D gravity simulator built with LOVE2D.

## Features
- N-body gravity simulation with real-time interactions
- Adjustable mass, atmospheric density, and spacetime curvature
- Toggleable visualization options for paths, velocity, and curvature
- Object merging functionality

## Controls

### Toggle Buttons:
- P : Show/hide object paths
- R : Reset simulation
- F : Display velocity of objects
- S : Display spacetime curvature

### Function Buttons:
- M : Merge selected objects

### Mouse Scroll:
- Scroll : Increase/decrease mass
- CTRL + Scroll : Increase/decrease atmospheric density
- D + Scroll : Increase/decrease spacetime factor
- E + Scroll : Zoom in/out


Executable Version

An executable version is available ( **physicsbuildv1** ), bundled with the necessary dependency DLL files. Simply extract the folder and run the executable to start the simulation.
